# Air Quality (PM2.5) Forecasting using LSTM

## Abstract

This report presents a comprehensive analysis and forecasting approach for Beijing air quality PM2.5 concentrations dataset using advanced deep learning techniques. The project implements sophisticated LSTM and GRU neural networks with ensemble methods to predict hourly PM2.5 levels based on historical air quality and meteorological data. The final ensemble model achieved significant performance improvements through advanced feature engineering, temporal sequence modeling, and robust preprocessing techniques.

## 1. Introduction

Air pollution, particularly PM2.5 (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometers), poses significant public health risks in urban environments [1]. Beijing, as one of the world's most populous cities, faces substantial air quality challenges. This project aims to develop accurate forecasting models for PM2.5 concentrations using machine learning techniques to support environmental monitoring and public health initiatives.

### 1.1 Problem Statement

• **Objective:** Predict hourly PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing  
• **Approach:** Supervised sequence prediction using recurrent neural networks  
• **Data:** Historical air quality and weather observations  
• **Evaluation:** Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) minimization  

### 1.2 Methodology Overview

The solution employs a multi-stage approach:
1. Comprehensive data exploration and preprocessing
2. Advanced feature engineering with temporal and cyclical features
3. Ensemble modeling using LSTM and GRU architectures
4. Robust validation and performance optimization

## 2. Data Exploration and Preprocessing

### 2.1 Dataset Overview

• **Training Data:** train.csv - Historical air quality measurements  
• **Test Data:** test.csv - Future time periods for prediction  
• **Target Variable:** PM2.5 concentrations (μg/m³)  
• **Features:** Meteorological and air quality parameters  

### 2.2 Data Quality Assessment

The initial data exploration revealed:
- **Missing Values:** Systematic handling using forward fill, backward fill, and mean imputation
- **Outliers:** Treated using IQR method with capping approach
- **Temporal Structure:** Hourly measurements with clear seasonal patterns

## 3. Model Architecture and Implementation

### 3.1 Advanced LSTM Model

For this project, an advanced LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model was built to capture the complex patterns in air quality data over time. The model uses **bidirectional LSTM layers**, which means it learns from the data in both forward and backward directions, giving it a fuller understanding of trends [2]. To avoid overfitting and keep the model reliable, **dropout layers** were added, and **batch normalization** was applied to keep the training stable.

After the sequence-learning part, the model feeds into several **dense layers** (regular neural network layers). These layers refine what the LSTM has learned, picking up on more detailed relationships in the data. Dropout continues to be used here to improve generalization. In the end, the model produces a **single number** —the predicted PM2.5 concentration.

### 3.2 GRU Ensemble Model

Alongside the LSTM, a GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) model was also created. GRUs work in a similar way to LSTMs but are simpler and faster to train, while still being very effective for time series forecasting. The GRU model also uses a **bidirectional layer**, so it can look at data from both directions in time. It then passes through another GRU layer, followed by **dense layers** that transform the learned patterns into a final prediction [3].

Like the LSTM model, dropout and batch normalization are used here as well to keep the model from overfitting and to ensure consistent training. The final output is again a single PM2.5 forecast value.

### 3.3 Training Configuration

• **Sequence Length:** 48 hours of historical data (varied from 1-72 hours in experiments)  
• **Optimizer:** Adam with learning rate 0.001 (tested Adam, RMSprop, SGD)  
• **Loss Function:** Huber loss (robust to outliers) and MSE for comparison  
• **Batch Size:** 32 (varied from 16-32 in experiments)  
• **Validation Split:** 15% for model evaluation  
• **Callbacks:** Early stopping, learning rate reduction, model checkpointing  

### 3.4 Experimental Methodology

A comprehensive experimental framework was designed to systematically evaluate different model architectures and hyperparameters:

**Experimental Design:**
- **10 Model Configurations:** Ranging from simple to advanced architectures
- **Hyperparameter Variations:** Sequence length (1-72 hours), model size (32-128 units), optimizers (Adam, RMSprop, SGD)
- **Loss Function Comparison:** MSE vs Huber loss for robustness

- **Reproducibility:** Fixed random seeds and consistent validation splits

**Evaluation Metrics:**

- **Secondary:** Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- **Efficiency:** Training time and convergence speed
- **Robustness:** Performance across different configurations
